# TileDrop
 
A single-player platformer/puzzler prototype where two characters must cross gaps by jumping on falling tiles while avoiding floating enemies; each level introduces a new mechanic and ramps difficulty intuitively.

Context: Built as a VFS design assignment to demonstrate intuitive introduction of mechanics and a steady difficulty ramp.\
Original state: Single scene with implemented player controller, enemy pathfinding, tile drop functionality.\
Now: Attempting to finish the game according the to the design sketch below.\

# Design Sketch

This is an old project that was designed during a VFS game design certificate and never completed. We were tasked to design a small game with multiple levels or scenes with a focus on introducing new features or difficulty for the player in an intuitive way. It is a single player platformer/puzzle game where the player has to figure out how to get two player characters across a gap by jumping on falling tiles and avoiding floating enemies.
